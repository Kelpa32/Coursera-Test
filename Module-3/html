                            Las Vegas is known for its casinos and world-class entertainment, but those are just two things to do in a city filled with attractions. On the Strip, you can take a spin on the world’s largest observation wheel, the High Roller, ride on a Venetian gondola or watch the iconic Fountains of Bellagio.
							Away from the Strip, Las Vegas has an collection of acclaimed museums covering atomic testing, neon signs and the mob-- 
							topics deeply connected to the city. Outside of the city, the Mojave Desert is filled with hiking and biking trails, scenic drives and expansive desert vistas.
							Officially known as Las Vegas Boulevard, this five-mile stretch of road is home to some of the world's largest hotels. Back in 1946 when the famous mobster Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel opened the Flamingo Hotel Casino, most of the hotels in Las Vegas were downtown. 
							Over the years, the hotel casinos sprang up like wildfire along the Strip, creating a concentrated area dedicated to tourism–and most visitors never leave the Strip. 
							Only a few of the original hotel casinos remain, but the Strip continues to add all kinds of attractions:  
							luxury shopping malls, upscale restaurants, and curb-side entertainment.

                            Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. 
							Divided during the Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.
							The original twin towns of Berlin and Kölln developed from the early 13th century onward, on an island of the Spree River (the site of Kölln) and a small portion of land on the north bank of the river facing the island (the site of Berlin). While still a small town, it became the capital of the electoral princes of Brandenburg from the end of the 15th century onward. From the late 17th and early 18th centuries, 
							when the electors of Brandenburg (also kings of Prussia from 1701) developed into powerful figures on the European political stage, the city expanded and gained a Baroque appearance
							new castles, such as Charlottenburg Palace, were built. The central quarter expanded and was embellished with broad avenues, handsome squares, and grandiose stone buildings. 
							The central area acquired broad north-south avenues, such as Wilhelmstrasse and Friedrichstrasse, and also its characteristic east-west road axis. Supplementing this main axis are several exit roads that now serve as major traffic arteries. 
							In the late 19th century suburbs developed around these arteries and their subsidiary streets. Where destruction during World War II was massive, 
							there has been large-scale construction of modern apartment and office buildings, one of the most famous being the Hansa Quarter, built by renowned architects from many countries.

                        <p>
                            Madrid, Spain's central capital, is a city of elegant boulevards and expansive, manicured parks such as the Buen Retiro. It’s renowned for its rich repositories of European art, including the Prado Museum’s works by Goya, Velázquez and other Spanish masters. 
							The heart of old Hapsburg Madrid is the portico-lined Plaza Mayor, and nearby is the baroque Royal Palace and Armory, displaying historic weaponry.
							Madrid is a city of contrasting styles, reflecting clearly the different periods in which change and development took place. The old centre, a maze of small streets around a few squares in the vicinity of the imposing Plaza Mayor, contrasts with the stately Neoclassical buildings and grand boulevards created by the most eminent architects of their day.
							Modern office buildings in the centre and swaths of apartment blocks around the outskirts attest to the styles and economic realities of present-day development.
							“Los Madriles” (“the Madrids”) is a traditional phrase that acknowledges the fact that each barrio (quarter) has developed its own style. There was also a geographical and social distinction among the geographically placed barrios altos (upper quarters), barrios centrales (middle quarters), and barrios bajos (lower quarters). 
							The last, spilling downhill from the Plaza Mayor along the Calle de Toledo toward the river, are still poor, albeit picturesque. Later development, also accommodating Madrid’s poorer citizens, spread down toward the reclaimed marshland on both sides of the river, where low-cost housing can still be found. 
							Construction of the Valdecarros district in the southeast of Madrid’s municipality, expected to house about 150,000 residents, began in 2007. Just over the brow of the hill is the Rastro, the popular flea market. 
							Despite a number of urban development plans, Madrid did not spread into the open spaces around it, not even crossing the Manzanares River until 1948.By contrast, the city as a whole has some extensive parks, with more open space overall than Paris.Some, like El Pardo or Casa de Campo, are survivals of hunting parks; the Retiro, on the other hand, is the site of a former royal palace.
